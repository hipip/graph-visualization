## this is graph visualization project (undirected graphs only) for a University homework of graph and optimization class, it includes the following algorithms:
- Distance between nodes using BFS algorithm
- Check if graph is connected
- Check if graph is a tree
- Transitive Closure 
- Graph Coloring using Welsh & Powell Algorithm
- Graph Coloring using DSATUR heuristic
- Graph Coloring using Recursive Largest First heuristic
